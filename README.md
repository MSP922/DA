## Background

### Outline
This SW is related to 'data augmentation engine' in 'Development of Driving Environment Data Transformation and Data Verification Technology for the Mutual Utilization of Self-driving Learning Data for Different Vehicles', and in detail, it is SW for LiDAR data augmentation.
### Data augmentation engine
New data with changed weather, lighting, objects, etc. is generated(augmented) from the acquired real environment information or virtual information.
- Environmental data augmentation: Generating other types of data in which the environment, object elements, etc. is conducted from the collected data and the environmental information at the time of collection
- Main object data augmentation: Inserting main target objects (VRU, Vehicle) on the road into the collected data in using AI
